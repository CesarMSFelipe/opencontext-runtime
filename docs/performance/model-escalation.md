# Model Escalation

## Purpose
Escalation starts with local/deterministic answers, retrieves more context when needed, asks approval for high-value insufficient runs, and only then escalates.

## Current Status
Implemented as local deterministic scaffolds; provider-specific cache and cost integrations are future adapters outside core.

## Related Commands
```bash
opencontext cache plan --query "review auth"
opencontext cache warm --workflow code-review
opencontext report cost
opencontext harness run --workflow explore-only --task "security audit"
```

## Implemented Code
