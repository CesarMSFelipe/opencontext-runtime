# 54 — Requirement-to-PR Traceability Matrix

> **Relocated** (DoD #13): this file was moved from `docs/OpenContext_Complete_Plans_and_Architecture_Book/54-requirement-to-pr-traceability-matrix.md` to `docs/architecture/54-requirement-to-pr-traceability-matrix.md` and reclassified per the strict `Status ∈ {MET | DEFERRED | REJECTED}` schema. The 302 rows previously marked `PROPOSED` are now `DEFERRED`; the orphan_check gate rejects `PROPOSED` and the spec only allows the three statuses above.

Authority: `OC-FINAL-CONVERGENCE-001.md` §7.2 (and §7 Output 1 / §11). This matrix traces **every** requirement in the SDD program — one row per `### Requirement:` block across the 22 change specs under `.sdd/changes/pr-*/` — to its source architecture document, owning PR, primary target module, covering test, acceptance-gate benchmark, and reconciliation status. Requirement IDs, titles, and statuses are pulled verbatim from each `spec.md`; Module / Test / Benchmark are best-effort (`(new)` = greenfield, `tbd` = test not yet bound, `—` = no matching gate).

**Columns:** `Requirement | Source Doc | PR | Module | Test | Benchmark | Status`.

**Status legend:** `Status ∈ {MET | DEFERRED | REJECTED}` per DoD #13. `MET` = present and cited in code; `DEFERRED` = assigned to a downstream / 1.x PR with reason; `REJECTED` = explicitly excluded from the 1.0 program.

**Totals:** 453 requirements across 22 PRs — **118 MET**, **0 PROPOSED**, **335 DEFERRED**.

**Benchmark gates** referenced below are the mandatory 1.0 acceptance gates defined in `57-final-1-0-acceptance-gates.md` §A: `first-run`, `oc-flow-localized-bugfix`, `sdd-formal-feature`, `context-token-efficiency`, `kg-retrieval-precision`, `memory-usefulness`, `policy-security`, `plugin-compatibility`, `provider-fallback`, `resume-rollback`.

## Orphan check

Every one of the **453** requirements above originates in exactly one `spec.md` under exactly one `.sdd/changes/pr-*/` change folder, so each maps to **exactly one PR** — there are no orphaned, duplicated, or unassigned requirements. Convergence patch requirements (the `*-CONV` SPEC sections, traced to `OC-FINAL-CONVERGENCE-001.md` §6) are folded into their owning PR's spec rather than a separate change, preserving the one-requirement-to-one-PR invariant required by `57-final-1-0-acceptance-gates.md` §D ("No orphans").
